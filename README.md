Pygame - Penguin Puzzler

This is a puzzle game. The goal is to slid along the ice and collide with the pink square. When you hit left, right, up, or down - your penguin will continue in that direction until it hits the edge of the screen, a rock, a hole, or the goal square. Holes will result in a return to the top left starting point. You win once you have reached the goal square. There are multiple levels from which you may choose. You cannot exit a level without exiting the game in any way other than completing the level.
