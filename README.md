Pygame
Save the penguins!

This will be a puzzle game. The purpose will be to slide along the ice and collide with the goal square. When you hit left, right, up, or down - your sprite will continue in that direction until it hits the edge of the screen, a rock, a hole, or the goal square. Holes will result in a loss of life (you have 3 total before GAME OVER) and a return to the top left starting point. You win once you have reached the goal square.
