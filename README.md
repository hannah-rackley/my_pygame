# Penguin Puzzler
-----------------

Penguin Puzzler is a classic puzzle game. The goal is to slide along the ice and collide with the pink square. When you hit left, right, up, or down on your keyboard - your penguin will continue in that direction until it hits the edge of the screen, a rock, a hole, or the goal square. Holes will result in a return to the top left starting point. 

There are three levels total:

# Getting Started
-----------------
If you would like to give this game a go, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed. I used the Anaconda Python environment (Python 2.7 version). Instructions for installing both are below:

[Pygame Install](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
[Anaconda Install](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)

Once you have the repository pulled down, you should be able to go to the Game File in your terminal and run ```python main.py``` to start the game.
